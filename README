                    HTF - The Haskell Test Framework
                  ====================================

The Haskell Test Framework (HTF for short) lets you define unit tests
(http://hunit.sourceforge.net), QuickCheck properties
(http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/), and black box tests in an
easy and convenient way. The HTF uses a custom preprocessor that collects
test definitions automatically. Furthermore, the preprocessor allows the
HTF to report failing test cases with exact file name and line number
information.

The documentation of the Test.Framework.Tutorial module provides a
tutorial for the HTF.

NOTE: If you use black box tests, you have to compile your program
with the `-threaded' option. Otherwise, your program just blocks
indefinitely!


Requirements:
-------------

- GHC (tested with 6.10.4 and 6.12.3)
- Some haskell libraries, see HTF.cabal


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

Execute the command `cabal install' inside the HTF root directory.
