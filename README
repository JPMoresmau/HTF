                    HTF - The Haskell Test Framework
                  ====================================

The HTF lets you write HUnit tests (http://hunit.sourceforge.net/) and
QuickCheck (http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/) properties in
an easy and convenient way. Additionally, the HTF provides a facility
for testing programs by running them and comparing the actual output
with the expected output.

The HTF uses Template Haskell to collect all tests and properties, so
that you do not need to write boilerplate code for that
purpose. Preprocessor macros provide you with file name and line
number information for tests and properties that failed.

Documentation is still work in progress. However, the file
tests/TestHTF.hs is a good example for what is possible with the HTF.


Requirements:
-------------

- Cabal 1.1.3
- GHC 6.4.1  (should compile but does not work properly with GHC 6.4.0 
              because the HUnit package in GHC 6.4.0 has a bug)
- cpphs 1.0 or cpp


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

runhaskell setup.hs configure
runhaskell setup.hs build
runhaskell setup.hs install   (probably as root)
