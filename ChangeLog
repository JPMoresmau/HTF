* 0.6.0.0 (2010-11-12)
  - generalized mtl dependency to accept version 1.1* and 2.0.*.

* 0.5.0.1 (2010-10-11)
  - preprocessor now parses bang patterns

* 0.5.0.0 (2010-10-05)
  - added `--hunit' flag to htfpp. (The `--hunit' flag causes assert-like
    macros to be expanded in a way that is backwards-compatible with the
    corresponding functions of the HUnit library.)
  - Some functions in Test.Framework.HUnitWrapper were renamed in a
    non-backwards compatible way. The assert*P functions are now called
    assert*Pretty, and the function assertSetEqual is now called
    assertListsEqualAsSet

* 0.4.0.0 (2010-09-02)
  - More specific version constraints in .cabal file

* 0.3.5.0 (2010-08-30)
  - Testable instance for lists

* 0.3.4.0 (2010-08-30)
  - htfpp now accepts code subject to preprocessing with cpp
